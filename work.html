      <h3>Eagle Scout Project</h3>
      <p>Preserve mass garments from around 1880 in a custom case and decorate a room in the church hall with memorabilia.</p>
      <p>We also scanned a bunch of documents, but it turns out those files got lost after the project. Would be the perfect thing to make a site for, but I do need to rescan all that information because my 17 year old self was concerned more with jailbreaking his phone than data loss.</p>

      <h3>internal</h3>
      <h4>slotting project</h4>
      <p>frontends to display data from an algorithm that can correctly “slot” products in the warehouse based on how often they sell. fast movers at the front. slow movers at the back</p>
      <h5>tablet application</h5>
      <p>used by warehouse associates to scan product off the shelf with a hand scanner and ipad, and scan it back to its new location. every action is logged with the correct usernames and quantites. if there is a discrepancy. management is notified.</p>
      <h5>desktop application</h5>
      <p>used by warehouse leadership to see what moves are available. they have the choice to distribute the work to warehouse associates, or “snooze” the move suggestions for 90 days.</p>
      <h3>fuzzy + not a lot of concrete evidence but i can get references for it.</h3>
      <p>i’m well respected. directors and executives say “we need more people like keagan.”</p>
      <p>i am getting better at using linux systems. i can now comfortably attempt to debug problems (and have before) on our production linux systems during an outage. </p>
      <p>i once wrote a script to circumvent our traditional label printing process, because our security service provider was BLOCKING THE PACKETS CONTAINING LABELS because they thought they were sketchy. almost every single day for a few months i had to reprint shipping labels with a custom perl script from my desk for warehouse associates. they know me by name, and always say “sheeesh” when i go back to the dc in slacks, loafers, and a  turtleneck.</p>
      <p>I managed our interactions with a third party development team that did A/B tests on the website. I ran the weekly touchpoints, helped their new devs set up test environments, tweaked AWS for them so certain tests could be ran. And when they messed up the website with an A/B test (by preventing anyone from clicking anything) i identified the problem and fixed it.</p>
      <p>just today i debuged a problematic pack table to a specific chrome machine not sending an “F9” keycode. the IT team had to bring me in to debug the software. “We want keagan” they said.</p>
      <p>all the work i do contributes to keeping the “money” printer which generates about $70 million in revenue annually. Black friday and cyber monday we both did a milli.</p>
